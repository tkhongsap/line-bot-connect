# Tasks: Azure OpenAI API Fix for Replit Development

Based on PRD: `tasks/prd-azure-openai-api-fix-replit.md`

## Relevant Files

- `src/config/centralized_config.py` - Add new Azure OpenAI configuration options for API detection and preferences
- `src/config/config_adapters.py` - Update adapter to expose new configuration options
- `src/config/validation.py` - Add validation rules for new configuration options
- `src/services/openai_service.py` - Enhance existing service with improved capability detection and routing
- `src/utils/azure_api_detector.py` - New: API capability detection and caching utility
- `src/utils/capability_cache.py` - New: File-based capability caching with TTL management
- `src/utils/api_router.py` - New: Intelligent API routing logic based on capabilities
- `src/exceptions/azure_openai_exceptions.py` - New: Structured error types for Azure OpenAI
- `src/routes/admin_routes.py` - Add health check endpoints for API status monitoring
- `data/api_capabilities.json` - New: Capability cache storage file
- `tests/unit/test_azure_api_detector.py` - Unit tests for API detector
- `tests/unit/test_capability_cache.py` - Unit tests for capability cache
- `tests/unit/test_api_router.py` - Unit tests for API router
- `tests/integration/test_openai_service_enhanced.py` - Integration tests for enhanced OpenAI service
- `tests/unit/test_azure_openai_exceptions.py` - Unit tests for new exception types

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` directory following existing project patterns
- Integration tests should be placed in `tests/integration/` directory
- Use `pytest` to run tests following existing project testing framework
- File-based caching uses `data/` directory which already exists in the project structure
