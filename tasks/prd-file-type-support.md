# Product Requirements Document: File Type Support Integration

## Introduction/Overview

This feature completes the file attachment capabilities for the LINE Bot by enabling support for all file types that OpenAI's API can process. Currently, the bot only supports image files, but the infrastructure for general file handling exists and needs to be activated. This will solve the problem of users being unable to share documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and other file types for AI analysis, providing a complete file sharing experience.

## Goals

1. **Complete File Support**: Enable users to upload and analyze any file type supported by OpenAI's API
2. **Seamless Integration**: Activate existing file handling infrastructure without disrupting current image processing
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Provide automatic AI analysis and summary for all uploaded files
4. **Increased Engagement**: Expand bot utility to drive higher user interaction and retention
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Ensure graceful handling of unsupported files and processing errors

## User Stories

1. **As a business user**, I want to upload PDF documents so that I can get AI-powered summaries and analysis
2. **As a student**, I want to share spreadsheets so that I can understand data patterns and get insights
3. **As a professional**, I want to upload presentation files so that I can get feedback and improvement suggestions
4. **As a developer**, I want to share code files so that I can get code review and optimization recommendations
5. **As any user**, I want clear error messages when files can't be processed so that I understand what went wrong
6. **As any user**, I want to know what file types are supported so that I can use the bot effectively

## Functional Requirements

1. **File Message Handler Registration**: The system must register a FileMessage handler in the LINE webhook to process non-image file uploads
2. **File Type Support**: The system must support all file types that OpenAI's API can process, including but not limited to:
   - Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, MD
   - Spreadsheets: XLS, XLSX, CSV, TSV
   - Presentations: PPT, PPTX
   - Code files: PY, JS, HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, SQL
   - Data files: JSON, XML, YAML, LOG
3. **File Size Validation**: The system must enforce the existing 20MB file size limit for general files
4. **Automatic Analysis**: The system must automatically analyze uploaded files and provide AI-generated summaries/insights
5. **File Processing Pipeline**: The system must use the existing FileProcessor utility to download files from LINE
6. **OpenAI Integration**: The system must upload files to OpenAI's file API and process them through GPT-4.1-nano
7. **Error Handling**: The system must provide clear, bilingual error messages for:
   - Unsupported file types
   - Files exceeding size limits
   - Download failures
   - Processing errors
8. **Conversation Context**: The system must maintain conversation history when processing file messages
9. **Response Format**: The system must provide structured responses including file analysis, key insights, and actionable recommendations
10. **Logging**: The system must log file processing activities including file name, size, type, and processing status

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **File Storage**: Will not implement long-term file storage or retrieval systems
2. **File Conversion**: Will not convert between file formats
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Will not enable multiple users to work on the same file
4. **File Editing**: Will not provide file modification capabilities
5. **Custom File Parsers**: Will rely entirely on OpenAI's built-in file processing capabilities
6. **File Preview**: Will not generate file thumbnails or previews
7. **Version Control**: Will not track file versions or changes

## Design Considerations

1. **Consistent UX**: File responses should follow the same bilingual format as existing image and text responses
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Feature should not affect existing image or text message functionality
3. **User Feedback**: Provide clear indication that file is being processed (may take longer than text responses)
4. **Error Recovery**: Offer alternative suggestions when files cannot be processed

## Technical Considerations

1. **LINE SDK Integration**: Import `FileMessage` from `linebot.models` and register the handler
2. **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage current `FileProcessor` class and `_handle_file_message` method
3. **OpenAI API**: Use existing file upload and processing capabilities in `OpenAIService`
4. **Error Propagation**: Ensure proper error handling from LINE API → FileProcessor → OpenAI API → User response
5. **Performance**: File processing may be slower than text/image responses due to upload and analysis time
6. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing file-specific rate limits to prevent abuse

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Increase in overall bot usage and user session duration
2. **File Processing Success Rate**: Target >95% successful file processing rate
3. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on file analysis quality and usefulness
4. **Feature Adoption**: Number of unique users utilizing file upload feature
5. **Error Rate Reduction**: Decrease in support requests related to file limitations
6. **Response Quality**: User ratings on AI analysis accuracy and helpfulness

## Open Questions

1. Should there be different analysis prompts based on file type (e.g., code review vs document summary)?
2. Do we need to implement file-specific rate limiting beyond the general 20MB size limit?
3. Should the bot proactively suggest file types when users mention wanting to share documents?
4. How should we handle very large files that may take significant processing time?
5. Should we provide file processing status updates for longer operations?

**Target Implementation**: This feature builds upon existing infrastructure and should integrate seamlessly with current LINE Bot operations while expanding capabilities to support comprehensive file analysis.
