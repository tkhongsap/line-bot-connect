# Task List: File Type Support Integration Implementation

Based on PRD: `prd-file-type-support.md`

## Overview
This task list implements comprehensive file type support for the LINE Bot, enabling users to upload and analyze any file type supported by OpenAI's API. The implementation builds upon existing infrastructure and activates dormant file handling capabilities.

## Task Breakdown

### T1: LINE SDK FileMessage Handler Integration [x]
- [x] T1.1: Import FileMessage from linebot.models in line_service.py
- [x] T1.2: Register FileMessage handler in LineService.__init__ using @self.handler.add decorator
- [x] T1.3: Connect FileMessage handler to existing _handle_file_message method
- [x] T1.4: Verify webhook registration accepts FileMessage events
- [x] T1.5: Test FileMessage handler activation with simple file upload

### T2: File Processing Pipeline Enhancement [x]
- [x] T2.1: Review and validate existing FileProcessor class in src/utils/file_utils.py
- [x] T2.2: Ensure _handle_file_message method properly calls FileProcessor.download_file_from_line
- [x] T2.3: Validate 20MB file size limit enforcement in FileProcessor
- [x] T2.4: Add file type detection and validation logic
- [x] T2.5: Implement comprehensive error handling for file download failures

### T3: OpenAI File API Integration [x]
- [x] T3.1: Review existing _upload_file method in OpenAIService
- [x] T3.2: Ensure file upload functionality works with OpenAI's file API
- [x] T3.3: Validate file processing through GPT-4.1-nano model
- [x] T3.4: Test file analysis response generation
- [x] T3.5: Implement proper file cleanup after processing

### T4: Error Handling and User Experience [x]
- [x] T4.1: Implement bilingual error messages for unsupported file types
- [x] T4.2: Add specific error handling for file size limit exceeded (20MB)
- [x] T4.3: Create user-friendly messages for file download failures
- [x] T4.4: Implement error responses for OpenAI API processing failures
- [x] T4.5: Add file processing status indication for users

### T5: Conversation Context and Logging [x]
- [x] T5.1: Ensure file messages are properly added to conversation history
- [x] T5.2: Add metadata tracking for file uploads (name, size, type)
- [x] T5.3: Implement comprehensive logging for file processing activities
- [x] T5.4: Validate conversation context maintenance after file processing
- [x] T5.5: Test file message integration with existing conversation flow

### T6: Testing and Quality Assurance [ ]
- [ ] T6.1: Create unit tests for FileMessage handler registration
- [ ] T6.2: Write integration tests for complete file processing pipeline
- [ ] T6.3: Test multiple file types (PDF, DOCX, XLS, PPT, code files, etc.)
- [ ] T6.4: Validate error handling scenarios with comprehensive test cases
- [ ] T6.5: Perform load testing with various file sizes up to 20MB limit

### T7: Documentation and Deployment [ ]
- [ ] T7.1: Update LINE Bot documentation with supported file types
- [ ] T7.2: Document file size limits and supported formats for users
- [ ] T7.3: Update API documentation with file processing capabilities
- [ ] T7.4: Create deployment checklist for production rollout
- [ ] T7.5: Prepare monitoring and analytics for file processing metrics

- `src/utils/file_utils.py` - File processing utility with download and validation logic
- `src/services/openai_service.py` - OpenAI integration service with file upload capabilities
- `src/services/conversation_service.py` - Conversation context management

- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests directory for file processing tests
- `docs/` - Documentation directory for user-facing file support information

## Technical Notes

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: Most file handling infrastructure already exists and needs activation
2. **Core Change**: Primary requirement is registering FileMessage handler in LINE webhook
3. **File Types**: Support all OpenAI API compatible formats (PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, code files, etc.)
4. **Size Limit**: 20MB maximum file size (already implemented in FileProcessor)
5. **Error Handling**: Bilingual error messages (Thai/English) consistent with existing bot responses
6. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing image and text message processing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All file types supported by OpenAI API can be uploaded and processed
- [ ] File processing success rate >95%
- [ ] Error messages are clear and bilingual
- [ ] No disruption to existing image or text message functionality
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring in place
- [ ] Complete test coverage for file processing pipeline

## Dependencies

- LINE Bot SDK with FileMessage support
- OpenAI API file processing capabilities
- Existing FileProcessor and OpenAIService infrastructure
- Current conversation and error handling systems
