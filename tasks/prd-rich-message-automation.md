## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Real-time personalization** based on individual user behavior (Phase 1 focuses on consistent content for all)
- **Advanced AI model training** or custom model development (using existing Azure OpenAI)
- **Canva Enterprise features** (working within Canva Pro limitations)
- **Multi-platform delivery** (LINE-only for initial implementation)
- **User-generated content** integration (admin-controlled content only)
- **Advanced analytics dashboard** (basic metrics tracking only)
- **A/B testing framework** (can be added in future iterations)
- **Interactive games or complex user workflows** within Rich Messages

## Design Considerations

### Template Strategy
- Use Canva Pro to create 15-20 high-quality template backgrounds
- Organize templates by theme: morning energy, evening calm, productivity, wellness, general motivation
- Design templates with designated text areas and consistent branding
- Export templates at 2500×1686px resolution for optimal LINE display

### Content Strategy
- Monday: Weekly goal setting and motivation
- Tuesday: Productivity tips and work-life balance
- Wednesday: Educational content and skill development
- Thursday: Wellness and mental health focus
- Friday: Achievement celebration and reflection
- Saturday: Lifestyle and personal growth
- Sunday: Gratitude and week review

### User Experience
- Rich Messages should feel personal and valuable
- Visual hierarchy should guide user attention to key message
- Call-to-action buttons should be clearly visible and accessible
- Loading times should be optimized for mobile networks

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Azure OpenAI**: Content generation service (already integrated)
- **LINE Bot SDK**: Rich Message API integration (already available)
- **Celery + Redis**: Task scheduling and queuing (already configured)
- **Python PIL/Pillow**: Image processing and text overlay
- **Timezone libraries**: For global user support

### Architecture Integration
- Extend existing `LineService` for Rich Message functionality
- Create new `RichMessageService` for automation logic
- Integrate with existing `OpenAIService` for content generation
- Use existing Celery infrastructure for scheduling
- Leverage current logging and monitoring systems

### Performance Considerations
- Template caching to reduce image generation time
- Batch processing for multiple timezone deliveries
- Image optimization for mobile networks
- Error handling and retry mechanisms for reliability

## Success Metrics

### Delivery Metrics
- **99%+ daily delivery success rate** across all users
- **<5 second average** Rich Message generation time
- **Zero missed days** due to system failures

### Engagement Metrics
- **Increase user engagement by 25%** compared to text-only messages
- **15%+ share rate** for Rich Messages via built-in share buttons
- **10%+ like/reaction rate** from users

### User Satisfaction
- **Reduce user churn by 15%** through consistent valuable content
- **Maintain 4.5+ star rating** in user feedback
- **<2% unsubscribe rate** from daily messages

### Operational Metrics
- **Reduce content creation time by 90%** (from manual to automated)
- **Zero administrator intervention required** for daily operations
- **<1 hour downtime per month** including maintenance

## Open Questions

1. **Timezone Detection:** How will we determine user timezones? (LINE profile data, manual setting, or IP-based detection?)

2. **Content Moderation:** What content filtering mechanisms should be implemented beyond basic appropriateness checks?

3. **Fallback Strategy:** What should happen if Azure OpenAI or image generation fails? (Pre-generated backup content?)

4. **User Preferences:** Should we implement opt-out mechanisms for users who don't want daily messages?

5. **Language Support:** Should the initial version support multiple languages, or focus on English first?

6. **Template Updates:** How frequently should new Canva templates be added, and who will manage this process?

7. **Analytics Integration:** Should we integrate with external analytics platforms or build custom tracking?

8. **Content Calendar:** Should we support special event content (holidays, awareness days) or maintain general themes?
